
Questions from Customer Eaton:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) They cannot tell if Coherence is even being used for caching.
   Answer See Below. coherence Logging or coherence mbeans
 
2) Should they change cache config to use distributed instead of local for cluster.
   Answer - yes see support note below 1503040.1 

3) How can they get cache stats?  
   Answer See Below, a different set of mbeans. (Not in the Portal App as described in several articles)

4) Should they set the ttl to zero or more.
   Answer see support note regarding setting to zero in coherence and setting timeout in ucm interface.
   http://www.ateam-oracle.com/optimizing-content-cache-performance-in-webcenter-portal/

5) Can they externalize coherence so they dont lose the caches if they bounce the portal servers.



For question 1
--------------
I created a Portal App that accesses UCS by following this tutorial
http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E28280_01/webcenter.1111/e10273/toc.htm

Got the sample at ORACLE_HOME/webcenter/modules/oracle.webcenter.content.integration_11.1.1/content-app-lib.ear.
The sample file location is: /content-app-lib.ear/APP-INF/classes/sample-content-coherence-cache-config.xml file.

I configured APP-INF/lib with a jar containing coherence config as per this article.
http://www.ateam-oracle.com/configure-coherence-for-oracle-webcenter-portal-framework-content-presenter-task-flow/



My App deployed and worked getting some content from UMS.
And I did not get a message in the log stating
"Unable to load Coherence configuration file content-coherence-cache-config.xml. Using in-memory (local) caches.
So i am to believe the Web is using coherence rather than its own cache impl.
BUT I could not find CacheConfig MBean as describe in article using the
WLS MBean Browser and looking at custom JMX App beans for my app.
And I could not find a Coherence MBean using JConsole.
I could find one for WLS instance containing OSB but only that one.


So I decided to decompile relevant code.
Figured out that

oracle.wcps.cache.CacheFactory is the class in question and it is located in
NOTE Implemtation based on this abstract class CacheFactory class
http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E23943_01/apirefs.1111/e15995/oracle/wcps/cache/CacheFactory.html

$fmwhome/Oracle_WC1/webcenter/modules/wcps-util_11.1.1/cache-1.0.jar
$fmwhome/Oracle_WC1/webcenter/modules/wcps-util_11.1.1/wcps-util-app-lib.ear
$fmwhome/Oracle_WC1/webcenter/modules/wcps-services_11.1.1.4.0/rest-client-server-1.0.0.0.jar
$fmwhome/Oracle_WC1/webcenter/modules/wcps-services_11.1.1.4.0/cache-1.0.jar

Note: the wcps-util-app-lib.ear library is deployed already to AdminServer and WC_Spaces
as seen in WLS console->deployments.
I also see MyPortalApplication_application1 as referencing it.
So I know the CoherenceCacheFactory class is available in the runtime

See Checked in project WCPS-UtilApp
I contains a few classes from cache-1.0.jar with my own debug.
I added this jar to the APP-INF/LIB and set prefer-local-classes in weblogic-application.xml

Now when I deploy and hit the page I can see that Coherence is being used.
The oracle creates their own Factory with a name 'product'
based on the prefix of passed in config file
content-coherence-cache-config.xml

I also figured out that Coherence itself will register MBeans with WLS if it is running.
This is the fastest way to determine if its running and at what WKA etc.

Goto EM and expand Weblogic Domain->domainName
Right click on domainName and choose 
System MBean Browser.

If coherence is running on AdminServer and WC_Spaces  you will see under

System MBean Browser
"Application Defined MBeans"
    Coherence
        - Server: AdminServer
	- Server: WC_Spaces
		- Cluster
		- Managment
		- Node
                        -     Click on the bean icon and in the right pane you will see attributes
                              of the bean, click on the attribute name to get its value.
                               Under this node can get the values like
                             - Multicast Address and Port
                             - Well known address and port
		- Platform

I have not expanded all nodes above.
But You can get most everthing here including jvm settings etc.


ALSO As describe in support article below you can see coherence logging if you change setting
to not be using JDK 

Here are the settings I used 

EXTRA_JAVA_PROPERTIES="${EXTRA_JAVA_PROPERTIES} -Dsoa.archives.dir=${SOA_ORACLE_HOME}/soa
 -Dsoa.oracle.home=${SOA_ORACLE_HOME} -Dsoa.instance.home=${DOMAIN_HOME}
 -Dtangosol.coherence.wka1=soabpm-vm -Dtangosol.coherence.localhost=soabpm-vm
   -Dtangosol.coherence.localport=8088 -Dtangosol.coherence.wka1.port=8088
 -Dtangosol.coherence.management=all 
-Dtangosol.coherence.log=/oracle/fmwhome/user_projects/domains/dev_soasuite/coherence.log

 -Dweblogic.transaction.blocking.commit=true -Dweblogic.transaction.blocking.rollback=true
 -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=${WL_HOME}/server/lib/DemoTrust.jks"
export EXTRA_JAVA_PROPERTIES

Note:
----- After adding the content-coherecne-config.jar file to the lib I no longer get the
html displayed from UCM in my Portal App, When I remove the jar containing the config file
the home.html text appears in the region again.

Solution: I discovered that when I used the config example for HA from the support doc
1503040.1     this worked correctly, could see content, and appears that repeated requests are not hitting UCM
other than:   COLLECTION_GET_REFERENCE [dbUser=anonymous][IsJava=1] 

So Things I now know
1) I did not have to have an external Coherence Cluster running.
2) The caches are loaded when queries are made by contentPresenter
3) The input config fiele MUST have the ending  -coherence-cache-config.xml
4) It works to deploy a portal project to a WC_Spaces configured server.
5) Having the product-coherence-cache-config.xml file in a jar in APP-INF/lib works as described in articles
6) I installed patch WebCenter 11.1.1.7.1 version (Bundle Patch 1)
   which included a fix for a bug where the coherence class is not used by content presenter
   Bug 16290696 
7) F5 on the browser ran my single jsp with a single repo query using a content provider task flow 
   to get home.html and the following caches were created and returned.
   (Without my debug version of the classes this info cannot be seen at runtime)

   Cache  repo.ucm.indexFieldsCache.UCM
   Cache  repo.ucm.nodeUidCache.UCM
   Cache  repo.ucm.securityInfoCache.UCM
   Cache  repo.ucm.nodePathToUidCache.UCM
8) the article is probably wrong, you will not see <Coherence> in the MBean browser for the custom
   PortalApp. but you will see if when looking at the mbeans for the server as described.
9) Coherence logging can be enabled as above to prove coherence is doing something and that it is
   reading a config from your portal app ear.
10) At least in this case it did not matter that my domain was 11.1.1.7 and my jdev
    webcenter extensions were 11.1.1.8
11) Coherence.jar is not in the app ear, it is already available on the server classpath
    through a shared library. 

For question 3
--------------
Cache Stats - Mbeans

Login  to em  http://localhost:7001/em
Expand the Weblogic Domain node and right click on the next link,
 'your domain name' and choose 'System MBean Browser'
In the MBean browser under 'Application Defined MBeans' section you will find
a node  named

oracle.wcps.cache/Server: WC_Spaces

"note: AFTER you have made you ucs queries from you app, you will find this node"

under it you will find stats for all defined app caches
Including hit count and miss count.
For example

content.repo.ucm.indexedFieldsCache.UCM
content.repo.ucm.nodePathToUidCache.UCM
content.repo.ucm.nodeUIDCache.UCM
content.repo.ucm.securityInfoCache.UCM
content.repo.ucm.securityUserCache.UCM
content.repo.ucm.typeNameCache.UCM
content.repo.ucm.typeNamesCache.UCM

Good Support article here
Oracle Support Document 1503040.1 (Configuring Coherence Cache for Content Presenter Task Flow in High Availability WebCenter Environment) 
can be found at: https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1503040.1
Note in this article they show a JConsole session with mbeans for distributed caches.
I did not see this at all when configured with the default local caches.
I didnt see the Service or StorageManager nodes as shown in the article screen snapshot.

Example in docs is missing one cache entry
Oracle Support Document 1558542.1 
(No Scheme For Cache: "binaryContentTypeCache" after enabling Coherence cache for Content Presenter) 
can be found at: https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1558542.1
